# FaceNet-FaceRecognition
This project implements a face recognition system using the MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) for face detection and InceptionResnetV1 for generating face embeddings. The system is capable of identifying known faces from a webcam feed by comparing their embeddings to previously stored known embeddings.
